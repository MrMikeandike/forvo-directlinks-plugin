# What is this?
A chrome/firefox extensiopn to use with forvo.com -- a site that has audio recordings of people pronouncing words in different languages.
The plugin just adds a button that lets you open pronounciations on forvo directly ( the link to the mp3 file is usually nowhere to be seen )
The button is added right next to the play button as a circle.

It *should* work throughout all of forvo.com. no idea how it would fair on mobile.
